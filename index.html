                            <h2>Car: Annis S-230</h2>
                            <hr>
                            <h2>Price: $1,500</h2> 
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <p>The underdog stories are not exclusive to sports, mythology and adult video industry. 
                            The S230 is the proof of that - always in the shadows of its famous compatriots, it didn't get to enjoy countless sponsorships and movie cameos under its belt. 
                            But behind the smell of takeout food and sewage, there is untapped potential to kick ass while staying under the radar. 
                            So if you've got nothing to lose, and excessive tail-happiness is but a quirk, it's yours for the taking. Don't pull any punches with it.</p>

                            <h2>Car: Sentinel SG4</h2>

                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <p>A gentleman of the recent past, the Sentinel SG4 was a sight to behold at a mafia meeting or a cross-city race. 
                        It might have lost some of its charm in the past years, but there's still some blood left in its veins. And with a bold bastard behind the wheel it's ready to spill more than a pint.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>Much like in the narco-business, on the car market one must keep up with demand not to lose the clientele.
                        This car is a well known and beloved among anyone into the JDM scene. All we did was make it better.
                        The ZR-350 will leave you asking for a fix and lead you to a discovery - your inner self revealed or your guts splattered all over some mountain pass.
                        If that's not a win-win scenario, we don't know what is.</p>
